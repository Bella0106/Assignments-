1. Create a theoretical graph using a pen and paper OR electronically. 
This is a link for my graph 

2. Implement the graph created in step 1 and apply breadth and depth-first search algorithms using C++




3. Compare both search algorithms in the context of Big O notations. 
The most widely used methods are Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) 
----Time complexity----
BFS = O(V + E) 
DFS = O(V + E)
----Space complexity---
BFS = O(V)
DFS = O(V)
----Path finding----
BFS = looks at nodes level by level, visiting all neighbors before going deeper.
DFS = goes deep along one path before backtracking.
----Completenese----
BFS = Always find solution if exist 
DFS = May get stuck in infinite depth 
----Use Cases----
BFS = Shortest path, web crawling 
DFS = Topological sort , cycle detection
