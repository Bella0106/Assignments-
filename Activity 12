1. 
If the low number becomes bigges than high number, stop the function. This is stopping point so the function doesn't go forever
So the base case is Stop when low is greater than the high
for example on this case it would be like low = 12 → STOP (because 12 > 10) 
return if low > hihg = this is the base case 
2. 
This means it multiplies by number going down by 2 not by 1 it stops only if n== 1. 
factorial (10) will never stop running it will go into infinite recursions becasue it never reaches the base case n == 1 so it would most likely to just crash it 
3. The fixed code would be look something like this 
def sum(low, high)
    return low if high == low  //for the base case 
    return high + sum(low, high - 1)
end
4. In python 
def print_numbers(arr):
    for item in arr:
        if isinstance(item, int):
            print(item)             
        else:
            print_numbers(item)      

array = [
    1, 2, 3,
    [4, 5, 6],
    7,
    [8,
        [9, 10, 11,
            [12, 13, 14]
        ]
    ],
    [15, 16, 17, 18, 19,
        [20, 21, 22,
            [23, 24, 25,
                [26, 27, 29]
            ],
            30, 31
        ],
        32
    ],
    33
]
