1. 
If the low number becomes bigges than high number, stop the function. This is stopping point so the function doesn't go forever
So the base case is Stop when low is greater than the high 
return if low > hihg 
2. 
This means it multiplies by number going down by 2 not by 1 it stops only if n== 1. 
factorial (10) will never stop running it will go into infinite recursions becasue it never reaches the base case n == 1 
3. The fixed code would be look something like this 
def sum(low, high)
    return 0 if high < low  
    return high + sum(low, high - 1)
end
