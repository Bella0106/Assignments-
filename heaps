1. Draw what the following heap would look like after we insert the value 11 into it
  
          11
        /    \
      10      8
     /  \    /  \
    6    9  7    4
   / \  / \
  2  1 3  5


2. Draw what the previous heap would look like after we delete the root node.
Final heap after the deleting of root node which is 11 
Remove the top number toot 
Move the last number to the top 
Swap it down with the bigger child until the heap rule is correct again 
the result would look something like look same as before 
          10
        /    \
       9      8
     /  \    /  \
    6    5  7    4
   / \  / 
  2  1 3
If you are asking what if we delete 10 then 
          9
        /    \
       6      8
     /  \    /  \
    3    5  7    4
   / \  / 
  2  1
3. Imagine youâ€™ve built a brand-new heap by inserting the following numbers into the heap in this particular order: 55, 22, 34, 10, 2, 99, 68. If you then pop them from the heap one at a time and insert the numbers into a new array, in what order would the numbers now appear?
 The orders after popping all the elements it would come out from largest to smallest 
99, 68, 55, 34, 22 ,10 ,2 
because max heap always keeps the biggest value at the root
